# Terms & Definitions

- A **vector** is an ordered list of scalar values called attributes.
- A **set** is an unordered collection of unique elements.

$$
∏ = product of elements in a collection
$$


$$
∑ = sum of elements in a collection
$$

$$
|S| = cardinal of |S| / number of elements in set S
$$

- sum or difference or product of vector & scalar will be a vector
- dot product of vectors is scalar
- product is done by multiplying row of first matrix * column of second matrix


- *f(x)* has a local minimum if *f(x)* ⋜ *f(c)* for every *x* around an open interval around *c*, *x = c*
- The minimum value among all the local minima is called the global minimum
- A **gradient** of a function is a vector of partial derivatives.
- Partial derivative of a function as the process of finding derivative of focusing on one of the function's inputs and by considering all other inputs as constant values.

$$
f(x,y) = ax + by + c
$$

**Gradient** of a function is

$$
⊽f = [𝜕f/\𝜕x, 𝜕f/\𝜕y]
$$
